# Contribution Guide

We appreciate your interest in contributing to **VibeHubAI Rules**.
This repository exists to help developers **build better software with AI assistance**, not to collect generic prompts or low-effort rules.

Please read this guide carefully before contributing.

---

## Philosophy

**Quality over quantity — always.**

VibeHubAI Rules are treated as **engineering assets**, not prompt dumps.

Our core principles:

* **Real-world tested**
  Rules should be based on actual production experience, not theory.

* **Opinionated and actionable**
  Clear guidance beats vague suggestions.

* **Tool-aware**
  Rules should be written with a specific AI tool in mind (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, Replit, etc.).

* **Consistency > novelty**
  We prefer proven patterns over trendy experiments.

* **No instant publishing**
  Every contribution is reviewed before acceptance.

## What You Can Contribute

You may contribute:

* ✅ AI tool rules (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Kiro, etc.)
* ✅ Best-practice instructions for a **specific stack**

  * Language (Java, Python, Go, Rust, TypeScript, etc.)
  * Framework (Spring Boot, React, FastAPI, NestJS, etc.)
* ✅ Security, performance, testing, or architecture rules
* ✅ Rule bundles (a curated set of related rules)

---

## What We Do NOT Accept

We will reject contributions that are:

* ❌ Generic or obvious (“write clean code”, “add tests”)
* ❌ AI-generated without human validation
* ❌ Duplicates of existing rules without improvement
* ❌ Overly long, academic, or abstract
* ❌ Marketing content or product promotion
* ❌ Tool-agnostic when tool-specific context is required

---

## Rule Quality Checklist

Before submitting, ensure your rule:

* Clearly states **who it’s for** (role, stack, tool)
* Solves a **real developer problem**
* Uses **imperative language** (do this / don’t do this)
* Includes **examples or constraints** where helpful
* Avoids contradictions with existing rules
* Is written as if **a senior engineer is mentoring an AI**

If you wouldn’t confidently use this rule in your own project — don’t submit it.

1. **Fork the repository**
2. Create a new branch:

4. Ensure naming, format, and metadata follow repository conventions
5. Open a Pull Request with:

   * What problem this rule solves
   * Which tool(s) it targets
   * Any assumptions or constraints

---

## Review Process

* All submissions are manually reviewed
* Feedback may be requested before acceptance
* Maintainers may:

  * Request changes
  * Suggest merging with an existing rule
  * Decline the contribution with rationale

Acceptance is based on **clarity, usefulness, and alignment**, not contributor seniority.
