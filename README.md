# VibeHubAI Rules

A curated collection of professional AI tool rules designed for modern development workflows.

This repository serves as a canonical and public source for high-quality rules used by AI coding assistants. It exists to provide developers with stable, battle-tested configurations that improve the accuracy and output of AI-driven development. Each rule in this collection is curated and focused on real-world utility rather than bulk accumulation.

## VibeHubAI Website

While this repository is the authoritative source for the rules, the [VibeHubAI website](https://vibehubai.com) offers an enhanced browsing and discovery experience. The website allows for easier filtering and visual exploration of available rules, while this GitHub repository remains the primary location for version control and community contributions.

## Supported Tools

VibeHubAI Rules currently supports the following tools:

- Cursor
- Windsurf
- Replit

Support for additional AI development environments and editors will be added systematically as the collection grows.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by tool to ensure easy navigation and integration:

- `cursor/`: Rules specifically formatted for Cursor.
- `windsurf/`: Rules optimized for Windsurf.
- `replit/`: Configurations for Replit deployments.
- `docs/`: Supplementary documentation and guides.

## Installation

For detailed instructions on how to implement these rules in your specific environment, please refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/how-to-install.md). The process typically involves adding the rule files to your project's configuration directory or specific tool settings.

## Contribution Philosophy

We prioritize quality over quantity. To maintain the integrity of the collection, we do not support instant publishing. All contributions undergo a review process to ensure they meet our standards for reliability and real-world applicability.

If you wish to contribute, please review our [Contribution Guide](docs/contribution-guide.md).

## Project Status

This is an early-stage project. The collection is growing, and we welcome technical feedback, issues, and discussions regarding rule performance and improvements.
